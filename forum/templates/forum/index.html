    <h2 class="font-weight-light display-4">Welcome to Metta Forum!</h2>
    <p>Metta in Pali means mercy or loving-kindness, friendliness, goodwill. The goal of any Meditation is for the
        practitioner to gain awareness and, like any other practices, it is crucial for them to communicate with one another
            in order to become a better practitioner. This forum will hopefully offer a cozy atmosphere in which people can
        share freely of their experiences and discuss their meditation techniques lovingly, friendly and in goodwill.</p>
